# Citi Bike Usage Analysis

## Overview
This project explores bike usage patterns within the Citi Bike system in New York City using predictive analytics techniques. The analysis aims to uncover temporal trends, user behaviors, and spatial dynamics to inform decision-making and optimize bike share operations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical data on bike trips within the Citi Bike system, including start time, stop time, station IDs, user types, trip durations, temperature, and other relevant attributes. The dataset spans multiple years and provides a comprehensive view of bike usage patterns over time.

## Objective
The primary objectives of the analysis include:
- Identifying peak usage times during the day, week, and month.
- Analyzing bike usage variations by season and weather conditions.
- Identifying popular start and end stations, as well as frequently traveled routes.
- Examining user demographics and behavior patterns.
- Forecasting future bike trip counts to inform resource allocation and operational planning.

## Methodology
The analysis employs a combination of descriptive analytics and time series forecasting techniques:
1. **Descriptive Analytics:** Utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover insights and patterns in the data. Key findings are visualized using plots and charts.
2. **Time Series Forecasting:** Employs the Prophet library for time series forecasting, allowing for the prediction of future bike trip counts based on historical data.

## Implementation
The analysis is implemented using Python programming language and various libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Prophet, and Scikit-learn. Jupyter Notebooks are used for code development and analysis, providing an interactive environment for exploration and experimentation.

## Results
The analysis yields valuable insights into bike usage patterns, user behaviors, and spatial-temporal dynamics within the Citi Bike system. Key findings include peak usage times, popular stations/routes, user demographics, and future trip forecasts.

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of predictive analytics in uncovering actionable insights for optimizing bike share operations. Recommendations are provided for addressing the identified business problem, including optimizing bike redistribution, enhancing user engagement, infrastructure planning, seasonal demand management, and continuous monitoring and evaluation.
